📌 Project Objective
Analyze IPL match and delivery data to extract insights about team performances, player statistics, match outcomes, and trends over the years. The project aims to understand key factors influencing wins and player impact in IPL games.

📊 Dataset Source
Kaggle - IPL Dataset

The datasets include:

matches.csv: Details of each match including teams, toss, venue, and winner.

deliveries.csv: Ball-by-ball data covering runs, wickets, batsmen, bowlers, and extras.

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Pandas & NumPy — Data preprocessing and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn — Data visualization

Scikit-learn (optional) — For any predictive modeling

🔍 Project Workflow

Data Loading and Cleaning

Data Preprocessing (e.g., fixing inconsistent team names)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find top teams, batsmen, and bowlers

Analysis of toss impact on match outcomes

Player performance metrics (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy)

Visualization of key insights

Optional advanced analysis like player rankings or match predictions

🚀 Results

Identified top-performing teams and players over IPL seasons.

Visualized trends in runs, wickets, and win percentages.

Highlighted the significance of toss decisions.

Provided a player ranking based on combined batting and bowling performances.
